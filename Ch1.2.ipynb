Recall the transformation of the state variables a and b in the fib-iter process of 1.2.2: $a ← a + b$ and $b ← a$ . Call this transformation T , and observe that applying T over and over again n times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair $Fib ( n + 1 )$ and $Fib ( n )$ . In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying $T^n$ , the $n^{th}$ power of the transformation T , starting with the pair (1, 0). Now consider T to be the special case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of transformations $T_{p q}$ , where $T_{p q}$ transforms the pair ( a , b ) according to a ← b q + a q + a p and b ← b p + a q . \n",

    "Exercise 1.23: The smallest-divisor procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers. This suggests that the values used for test-divisor should not be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …, but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, …. To implement this change, define a procedure `next` that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the smallest-divisor procedure to use (next test-divisor) instead of (+ test-divisor 1). With timed-prime-test incorporating this modified version of smallest-divisor, run the test for each of the 12 primes found in Exercise 1.22. Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2?"

    "Exercise 1.28: One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the Miller-Rabin test (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate form of Fermat’s Little Theorem, which states that if n is a prime number and a is any positive integer less than n , then a raised to the ( n − 1 ) -st power is congruent to 1 modulo n . To test the primality of a number n by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number a < n and raise a to the ( n − 1 ) -st power modulo n using the expmod procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in expmod, we check to see if we have discovered a “nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n ,” that is, a number not equal to 1 or n − 1 whose square is equal to 1 modulo n . It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of 1 exists, then n is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if n is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers a < n , computing a n − 1 in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n . (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the expmod procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to fermat-test. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient way to make expmod signal is to have it return 0."
